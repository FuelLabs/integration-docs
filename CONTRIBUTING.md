# Contributing

If you want to add an integration to the docs create a new section in the appropriate file (oracle, indexer, wallet).  If the integration does not fit in one of these categories create a new file and add the section.

Once you have created the new section create a pr, request a review from the devrel team, and ensure the ci checks are passing.
